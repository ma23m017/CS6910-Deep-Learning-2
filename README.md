# CS6910-Deep-Learning-2

## Part A

In this part I am training a CNN model from scratch and tuning the hyperparameters so that the model performs well. I have used python for my implementations. I have used the required packages from PyTorch and Torchvision.

### Working:
I have made a CNN model which consists of 5 convolutional layers, after each convolution layer I have added an activation and a max-pooling layer which together makes a block. After 5 such blocks there is 1 dense layer and then finally 1 output layer with 10 neurons, 1 for each classes.
